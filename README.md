# Steam Link

A small browser extension that, when clicked while on a steam page, will open the page in the steam desktop application. No more issues with being signed out in the browser or trying to use steam search to find that one workshop mod you need because you can't get that link your friend sent to open properly!


If you're curious how this works, it's pretty simple - it simply prefixes the url with `steam://openurl/`, so the url `https://store.steampowered.com/app/1041920/` becomes `steam://openurl/https://store.steampowered.com/app/1041920/`, and then if you allow the extension to open the url with steam, steam will open to that page!
